# Project Details
## Full-stack project completed in December 2025. \
Link to live demo: https://frontend-production-7a77.up.railway.app/login
Note: If you plan to clone and deploy this locally, you will need .env files for both the front-end and back-end.

Built as a full-stack project to get more familiarity with TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL. Uses calls to Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to generate summaries of Zoom / Google Meets meetings. The models were instructed to create Jira-like tickets to expedite the creation process. Users can edit assignment details and descriptions, and approve or disapprove suggestions from the model. \

## Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, JS \
## Backend: Python, FastAPI, Authentication with JWT \
## Other: PostgreSQL Database, Containerized then deployed onto a Railway server \
