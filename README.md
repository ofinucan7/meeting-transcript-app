# Project Details
## Full-stack project completed in December 2025. 
Link to live demo: https://frontend-production-7a77.up.railway.app/login <br>
Note: If you plan to clone and deploy this locally, you will need .env files for both the front-end and back-end. <br>

Built as a full-stack project to get more familiarity with TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL. Uses calls to Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to generate summaries of Zoom / Google Meets meetings. The models were instructed to create Jira-like tickets to expedite the creation process. Users can edit assignment details and descriptions, and approve or disapprove suggestions from the model. <br>

# Stack
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, JS <br>
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Authentication with JWT <br>
- Other: PostgreSQL Database, Containerized then deployed onto a Railway server <br>
